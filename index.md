# Background

I am a postgraduate researcher, currently modelling the geophysical responses of CO<sub>2</sub> to frequency-dependent anisotropy and attenuation.

I am currently at the University of Edinburgh, funded by an EPSRC iCase Studentship for the project "<i>Integrating rock physics, geomechanics and survey design for carbon capture and storage</i>".

Beyond my work, I am a lifelong rugby player, currently playing for the [Caledonian Thebans](https://www.caledonianthebans.com/). You can also find me engrossed in collecting Pok√©mon cards or hiking around the Scottish Highlands.
